# Money Circle
This project was bootstrapped in my beginning journey of learning web technologies in 2017 for AlMakinah bootcamp program. 

## Idea
Rotating savings and credit associations are a popular way for people to save money around the world. But unsurprisingly, most people don’t use this long phrase — or even its acronym, ROSCA — to refer to them as it is an academic term.

ROSCAs - which people refer to as "money clubs" have dozens of names around the world. While each of these terms means roughly the same thing, there are differences and variations within each country, culture, religion, and committee.

Here are just some of the names used to describe rotating savings clubs around the world.
- Adashe (Nigeria)
- Ajo (Nigeria)
- Ayuuto (South Somalia/Republic of Somaliland)
- Chama (East Africa)
- Ekub (Ethiopia and Eritrea)
- Esusu (Nigeria)
- Gameeya (Egypt)
- Hagbad (Somalia)
- Jojuma (Togo)
- Tontine (Côte d’Ivoire and Cameroon)
- Noufi (Tunisia)
- Stockfair (South Africa, Zimbabwe)
- Stokvel (South Africa)
- Upato (Tanzania, Zambia)
